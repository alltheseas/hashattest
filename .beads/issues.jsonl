{"id":"hashattest-0g7","title":"Research: temporal attestation for detecting in-place package modifications","description":"Deep dive on using hash-over-time comparison to detect global attacks where packages are modified in-place (Codecov, Polyfill.io style). Explore: how builders track attestation history, what triggers a temporal mismatch alert, how to handle legitimate version updates vs malicious modifications.","notes":"CRITICAL REVIEW: 5 high-severity issues identified. (1) Nostr ≠ append-only log — relays can fork views, drop history, serve different timelines. Temporal attestation on nostr is tamper-evidence not tamper-proof. Need witness cosigning or consistency proofs. (2) TOFU anchor poisoning — first-seen hash can be poisoned if attacker controls early resolution. Need threshold anchoring (k-of-n independent builders). (3) strong_password misclassified — was new malicious version, not in-place modification. Temporal same-version checks don't catch new versions. (4) Absence ≠ signal without signed expiry semantics — relay churn, censorship, partition are normal on nostr. (5) Anti-Sybil missing — web-of-trust alone insufficient, need k-of-n, operator diversity, ASN/geo diversity, key age, reputation decay. STATUS: Research complete, design work needed before implementation. Must solve relay equivocation, quorum policy, builder independence proofs, interop with existing logs (SumDB/Rekor).","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-02-23T10:57:55.879998-06:00","created_by":"e","updated_at":"2026-02-23T11:15:56.451123-06:00"}
{"id":"hashattest-dzt","title":"Research: source-to-archive verification for detecting build system compromise","description":"Deep dive on verifying that published package archives match source repos. Catches XZ Utils, SolarWinds, event-stream style attacks where malicious code exists in the published artifact but not the source. Explore: feasibility per package manager, reproducible builds at dependency level, how builders could automate source-to-archive comparison.","notes":"CRITICAL REVIEW: Key issues identified. (1) Source-to-archive proves correspondence, not safety — if malicious code is genuinely in source repo, rebuild shows a match. event-stream specific case IS caught (tarball had code not in git), but general class of 'malicious source' is not. (2) Reproducibility claims overgeneralized — 'Cargo/npm 100%' is from ICSE 2025 specific dataset, not universal truth. (3) 70-80% coverage figure unsupported — varies heavily by ecosystem, popularity tier, package type. (4) Artifact identity underspecified — need canonical coordinates (registry, name, version, filename/classifier/platform, algo, digest). (5) Privacy: publishing attestations leaks private stack choices and patch cadence. STATUS: Research complete, design work needed. Must define exact verification object per ecosystem, quorum policy (block vs warn), and privacy mitigations.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-02-23T10:57:57.904903-06:00","created_by":"e","updated_at":"2026-02-23T11:16:00.425056-06:00"}
